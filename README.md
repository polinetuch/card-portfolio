# deboodle
A portfolio that I am currently building for a friend of mine, who designs greeting cards.

# Users stories
- Users can browse all cards when click on 'browse cards' buttons
- When users click on 'customise cards' button, the order form will pop up to submit the following information:
  - Users' names, contact details and addresses
  - Types of cards (birthday, anniversary, wedding and many more)
  - When users finish the forms, submit button will appear
 - Users can access to the owner/artist contact details by clicking on contact
